## Genetic Algorithm

### Description: 
Design and implement a genetic programming system to evolve some perceptrons that match well with a given training set. A training set is a collection of tuples of the form (x1, ..., xn, l), where xiâ€™s are real numbers and l is either 1 (positive example) or 0 (negative example). 
  
### Fitness Function: 
For each instance in the training set, if the given program agrees with the label, then it gets 0 point, otherwise, it gets -1 point. The fitness value is then the sum. The maximum value is 0.
